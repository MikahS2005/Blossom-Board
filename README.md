# 1. Blossom-Board (Personal Project) & 2. Predictive Modelling and Risk Classification (school project)

PERSONAL PROJECT

Blossom Board is a productivity application that allows users to manage tasks, track progress and study. It combines a to-do list with tabbed categories( like school, personal and priority) and a pomodoro timer. There is a soft, floral-inspired theme. To develop this app C++ and Qt was used.

Time Spent: About  3-5 days

SCHOOL PROJECT

For this project, I was provided with a data set showing key accident factors and how they related to the frequency of accidents. I was required to analyse this data .I used data mining methods to analyse, model and predict traffic accidents in MATLAB. Specifically, the coded solution used multiple linear regression to predict accident counts and multiple logistic regression to classify high-risk accident zones, based on key correlated accident factors provided. It further identified clusters withing the data using k-means clustering.

Time Spent: About 1-2 weeks.

Results accident count predictor: A linear regression model was used to predict the number of accidents in an area based on geographical, environmental and other factors. The results show the accuracy of the model compared to the actual number of accidents.

Results of high risk accident prediction: A logistic regression model was used to predict whether an area was at a high risk for accidents based on a variety of factors. The results show the accuracy of the model in determining whether or not an area is high risk.

k-means clustering: groupings between the two factors with the highest correlation to the number of accidents from the dataset.
